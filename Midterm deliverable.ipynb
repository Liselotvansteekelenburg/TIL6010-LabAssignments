    "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected various sectors, including transportation and mobility. With lockdowns and working remote becomming the norm, travel behaviours have altered, particularly on the dutch highway system. Understanding how these shifts have affected traffic intensities is crucial for future transportation planning and infrastructure development. In the Netherlands, a decline in traffic intensities on highways have become evident. This research examines the extent of the pandemic's impact on traffic intensities, specifically on the A4 highway between Rotterdam and Amsterdam. To address this, one main question and three sub-questions will be explored. "

    "The aim of this research is to use traffic data up to 2019 to extrapolate traffic intensities untill 2023. This is then used to show the difference between the extrapolated traffic intensities in 2023 and the measured data. The main objective of this research is to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted rush hour traffic intensities on weekdays on the A4 highway between Rotterdam and Amsterdam. To answer the main objective, three sub questions are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main objective: \n",
    "#### To what extent did the Covid Pandemic have an impact on rush hour traffic intensities on weekdays on the A4 highway between Rotterdam & Amsterdam?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What were traffic intensities on the A4 between 2020 and 2023 (after COVID era)?\n",
    "* What are the projected traffic intensities untill 2023 based on the pre-Covid data? (extrapolated from 2019)\n",
    "* What is the difference between passenger vehicles and freight traffic?\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing our research, we have relied on several assumptions to develop a realistic estimate of traffic intensities on the A4. First, we assumed that the traffic data from 2019 represents a normal pre-pandemic condition. This year was chosen as it was the last full calendar year before the disruptions caused by COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we decided to collect the data from all main trajectories of the A4 to calculate average traffic intensities. This approach was necessary to gain a more comprehensive view of traffic flows, as individual trajectories can exhibit varying intensities due to local factors such as exits, highway intersections and other variables. By utilizing averages, we can better establish the overall trend on the highway and understand the impact of COVID-19 on traffic patterns at a macro level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered the increasing influence of remote working, which may have resulted in lasting changes to traffic patterns. We assumed that while traffic intensities in 2023 might be lower than the values from 2019, a stabilization could occur depending on how society adapts to new norms. These assumptions form the foundation of our analyses and assist us in interpreting the results within the broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on traffic intensities.\n",

    "As lockdowns were implemented and remote work became the norm, the A4 highway experienced drastic changes in traffic intensities. During the early months of the pandemic in 2020, traffic volumes on Dutch highways plummeted. During the weekdays, a minimum was reached in the second week of April, when traffic was only half of what it had been a year earlier (CBS, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph shows the traffic intensities during morning (07:00-09:00) and afternoon (16:00-18:00) rush hours on the A4 highway between Rotterdam and Amsterdam for the years 2020 to 2023, showing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on traffic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "As restrictions began to ease in mid-2020, traffic volumes started to recover, but they did not return to pre-pandemic levels immediately. By September 2020, traffic volumes were reported to be about 10% lower than in the same month in 2019 (KiM, 2020). The initial recovery was characterized by increased car usage as people avoided public transport due to health concerns. Notably, about 30% of commuters indicated they planned to continue working from home at least part-time (CBS, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifts in Traffic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The post-pandemic period has seen a notable shift in traffic patterns. Traditional rush hours have become less pronounced, with many commuters opting for staggered schedules. Data from the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management indicated that traffic flows during peak hours reduced by approximately 15% in 2021 compared to 2019 levels. Additionally, cycling saw a significant increase, with a reported 20% rise in cycling trips during the summer of 2020 (Fietsersbond, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ongoing Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these positive shifts, challenges remain. By 2022, traffic volumes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and even surpassed them on certain routes. The Dutch National Road Authority (Rijkswaterstaat) reported that congestion on highways increased by 30% in 2022 compared to 2021, particularly around major cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam. This resurgence poses renewed challenges related to congestion, prompting discussions about infrastructure improvements and investments in public transport (Rijkswaterstaat, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably reshaped traffic dynamics on Dutch highways. While initial declines provided a glimpse of potential benefits associated with reduced vehicle use, the gradual return to increased traffic underscores the need for ongoing adaptations in transportation planning. The lessons learned during this period may guide future policies aimed at fostering more resilient and sustainable transport systems in the Netherlands. As the country continues to navigate these changes, the focus remains on balancing mobility needs with environmental considerations and public health.\n",
